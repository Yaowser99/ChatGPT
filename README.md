## Chapter 4 - What are Embeddings?
 * Embeddings are vector or numerical representations of text that capture its semantic meaning.
 * Used OpenAI;s embedding model to create these vector representations, and compute teh cosine distance to compare the similarity between texts.
 * Unlocks applications like semantic search and recommendation engines that could relate text by their semantic meaning. 

## Chapter 5 - Embeddings for AI Applications
 * Using OpenAI embedding model to enable real_world use cases, includign semantic search and recommendation engines.
 * See how embeddings can be used for classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and categorization.

## Chapter 6 - Vector Databases
 * One step towards creating a production system by learnign about vector databases,
 * Learned how to use Chroma to embed, store, update, and query vectors in a more repreducible and efficient way.

### What's next? 
 * For enterprise companies with more funds or start-ups looking to move quickly to capture demand, a cloud-based, managed vector database could be a good option. Two of the most popular are: Pinecone and Weaviate
 * For many AI Applications, including chatbots, embeddings and vector databases are only a part of a larger system, which may also include large language models. LangChain is a great framework to tie all of these pieces together under a single, unified syntax.
