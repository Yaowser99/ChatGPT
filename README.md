# OpenAI

## Chapter 1 - Intro to OpenAI API
 * What was it used for, how to create an API key for authentication, and how to make requests to the API via the completions endpoint
 * Creating and managing organizations, which we can use to metigate reate limit risks and better manage usage and expenditure.

## Chapter 2 - OpenAI Model Applications
 * Solved a range of tasks, including question answering, text transformation, content generation, sentiment analysis, and categorization.
 * Control the model's behavior by twesking the max_tokens and temperature parameters.
 * Unlock potential for multi-turn conversations using the Chat Completions endpoint, and created an AI chatbot.

## Chapter 3 - Moderation and Audio Models
 * Learning about moderation and audio functionalities, and used these modles to detect inappropriate content, and translate and transcribe audio recordings.
 * Chaining models together to start automating more complex tasks like creating meeting summaries form recordings. 

## Chapter 4 - What are Embeddings?
 * Embeddings are vector or numerical representations of text that capture its semantic meaning.
 * Used OpenAI;s embedding model to create these vector representations, and compute teh cosine distance to compare the similarity between texts.
 * Unlocks applications like semantic search and recommendation engines that could relate text by their semantic meaning. 

## Chapter 5 - Embeddings for AI Applications
 * Using OpenAI embedding model to enable real_world use cases, includign semantic search and recommendation engines.
 * See how embeddings can be used for classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and categorization.

## Chapter 6 - Vector Databases
 * One step towards creating a production system by learnign about vector databases,
 * Learned how to use Chroma to embed, store, update, and query vectors in a more repreducible and efficient way.

### What's next? 
 * For enterprise companies with more funds or start-ups looking to move quickly to capture demand, a cloud-based, managed vector database could be a good option. Two of the most popular are: Pinecone and Weaviate
 * For many AI Applications, including chatbots, embeddings and vector databases are only a part of a larger system, which may also include large language models. LangChain is a great framework to tie all of these pieces together under a single, unified syntax.
